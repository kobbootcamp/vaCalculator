# VA Calculator

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) administers an income-assistance program called Veterans Pension (or, in the case of dependents who survive a deceased veteran, Survivors Pension) about which many misperceptions exist. There are many income-related factors that determine the monthly Pension rate to which a veteran or veteranâ€™s surviving dependent may be entitled. Potential applicants may use this application to estimate their potential Pension rate.
